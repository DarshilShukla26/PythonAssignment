#Aim: You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification. 

k = int(input())

words_list = []

for i in range((k)):
  word = input()
  words_list.append(word)
  if word in counter_dict:
    counter_dict[word]++
  else:
    counter_dict[word] = 1
    
print(len(counter_dict))
print(' '.join([str(counter_dict[word]) for word in counter_dict]))
